1. Handshake is a term used in computer networking to refer to the exchange of information between two devices to establish a connection.
2. NSS stands for Network Segment Size and is a term used in Handshake to refer to the maximum amount of data that can be sent in one segment.
3. NTU stands for Network Transmission Unit and is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted in one transmission.
4. NSS and NTU are important factors to consider when transferring data to or from a buffer, as they determine the limitations on the amount of data that can be transferred.
5. NSS is limited by the maximum size of a segment, while NTU is limited by the maximum transmission unit.
6. Local hosts must determine their maximum link layer protocol length before setting the NSS.
7. Ethernet and PPP are examples of communication protocols with set NTU values.
8. The early NTU value for Ethernet was 1500 bits, with 40 bits allocated for TCP/IP data, leaving 1460 bits for NSS.
9. These values have not changed significantly since their initial implementation.
10. NSS and NTU are important considerations for efficient and effective data transfer.
11. Handshake is a crucial aspect of establishing connection in computer networking.
12. NSS is a term used to define the maximum size of a data segment in Handshake.
13. NTU refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted in one transmission.
14. Both NSS and NTU are important factors to consider when transferring data to or from a buffer.
15. The maximum size of a segment is limited by NSS in Handshake.
16. The maximum transmission unit is limited by NTU.
17. Local hosts must determine their maximum link layer protocol length before setting NSS.
18. Ethernet and PPP are examples of communication protocols with set NTU values.
19. Early NTU value for Ethernet was 1500 bits.
20. TCP/IP data is allocated 40 bits in the Ethernet NTU value, leaving 1460 bits for NSS.
