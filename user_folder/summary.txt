Transport-Layer Service

1. The transport layer is responsible for providing communication services between two processes on different host devices. 
2. It is the fourth layer of the OSI model and sits on top of the network layer. 
3. The main services provided by the transport layer are multiplexing and demultiplexing, reliable data transfer, and congestion control. 
4. Multiplexing is the process of combining multiple data streams into a single stream for transmission. 
5. Demultiplexing is the process of separating the received data back into its original streams. 
6. This allows for multiple applications to communicate simultaneously over a single network connection. 
7. The transport layer also provides error checking and retransmission of lost or corrupted data to ensure reliable data transfer. 
8. Congestion control manages the flow of data to prevent network congestion and ensure efficient use of network resources. 
9. The two main transport layer protocols are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). 
10. These protocols use port numbers to identify the different processes or applications on a host device. 
11. TCP is connection-oriented, meaning a connection must be established between the two devices before data transfer can begin. 
12. TCP uses a three-way handshake process to establish a connection and ensure reliable data transfer. 
13. This involves sending and receiving special segments between the two devices. 
14. Once a connection is established, TCP provides a full-duplex service, allowing data to be sent and received simultaneously between the two devices. 
15. TCP segments have a maximum segment size (MSS) that determines the amount of data that can be sent in one segment. 
16. The MSS is typically determined by the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the underlying link-layer protocol. 
17. Ethernet and PPP, two common link-layer protocols, have an MTU of 1,500 bytes. 
18. UDP, on the other hand, is connectionless and does not provide reliable data transfer or flow control. 
19. It is commonly used for applications that can tolerate some data loss, such as streaming video or audio. 
20. Multicasting, the transfer of data from one sender to many receivers, is not possible with TCP but can be achieved with UDP.
